I was born in a city named Bikaner situated in north-western Rajasthan which is a part of the great Thar desert.
<br>In childhood I was excellant in martial arts, received medals in several games that showed my interest of sports.  
<br>I completed my schooling from Tagore Public School, Vaishali Nagar, Jaipur in science stream.After which I changed my stream to Humanities as according to my interest and goal to serve the society and make reforms for public welfare.
<br>In graduation, my disciplines were History, Geography and Economics.
When I was in final year of my graduation I studied Modern Indian History as my one of subject, from there I got know that how administration and good governance can change a country's future which enunciated my interest in Law.
I got to know the importance of law in administration and governance after which I chose Law as my next discipline.It also opened up doors of judicial exams for me as option to serve public.
