When I was in final year of my graduation I studied Modern Indian History as my one of subject, from there I got know that how law is the mechanism on which state machinery works either efficiently or inefficiently. which may result into good governance or bad governance and can change the country's future, this enunciated my interest in Law and I cracked the University Law Entrance Test(ULET) for University Of Rajasthan<html>
